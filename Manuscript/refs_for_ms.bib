@article{braukmann2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract Although DNA metabarcoding is an attractive approach for monitoring biodiversity, it is often difficult to detect all the species present in a bulk sample. In particular, sequence recovery for a given species depends on its biomass and mitome copy number as well as the primer set employed for PCR. To examine these variables, we constructed a mock community of terrestrial arthropods comprised of 374 species. We used this community to examine how species recovery was impacted when amplicon pools were constructed in four ways. The first two protocols involved the construction of bulk DNA extracts from different body segments (Bulk Abdomen, Bulk Leg). The other protocols involved the production of DNA extracts from single legs which were then merged prior to PCR (Composite Leg) or PCR-amplified separately (Single Leg) and then pooled. The amplicons generated by these four treatments were then sequenced on three platforms (Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM, Ion Torrent S5). The choice of sequencing platform did not substantially influence species recovery, although the Miseq delivered the highest sequence quality. As expected, species recovery was most efficient from the Single Leg treatment because amplicon abundance varied little among taxa. Among the three treatments where PCR occurred after pooling, the Bulk Abdomen treatment produced a more uniform read abundance than the Bulk Leg or Composite Leg treatment. Primer choice also influenced species recovery and evenness. Our results reveal how variation in protocols can have substantial impacts on perceived diversity unless sequencing coverage is sufficient to reach an asymptote.

@book{belgrano2005aquatic,
	Abstract = {This volume provides a current synthesis of theoretical and empirical food web research. Whether they are binary systems or weighted networks, food webs are of particular interest to ecologists in providing a macroscopic view of ecosystems. They describe interactions between species and their environment, and subsequent advances in the understanding of their structure, function, and dynamics are of vital importance to ecosystem management and conservation. Aquatic Food Webs provides a synthesis of the current issues in food web theory and its applications, covering issues of structure, function, scaling, complexity, and stability in the contexts of conservation, fisheries, and climate. Although the focus of this volume is upon aquatic food webs (where many of the recent advances have been made), any ecologist with an interest in food web theory and its applications will find the issues addressed in this book of value and use. This advanced textbook is suitable for graduate level students as well as professional researchers in community, ecosystem, and theoretical ecology, in aquatic ecology, and in conservation biology.},

@article{godhe_quantification_2008,
	Abstract = {Two real-time {PCR} assays targeting the small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal {DNA} (rDNA) were designed to assess the proportional biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates in marine coastal water. The reverse primer for the diatom assay was designed to be class specific, and the dinoflagellate-specific reverse primer was obtained from the literature. For both targets, we used universal eukaryotic SSU rDNA forward primers. Specificity was confirmed by using a BLAST search and by amplification of cultures of various phytoplankton taxa. Reaction conditions were optimized for each primer set with linearized plasmids from cloned SSU rDNA fragments. The number of SSU rDNA copies per cell was estimated for six species of diatoms and nine species of dinoflagellates; these were significantly correlated to the biovolumes of the cells. Nineteen field samples were collected along the Swedish west coast and subjected to the two real-time {PCR} assays. The linear regression of the proportion of SSU rDNA copies of dinoflagellate and diatom origin versus the proportion of dinoflagellate and diatom biovolumes or biomass per liter was significant. For diatoms, linear regression of the number of SSU rDNA copies versus biovolume or biomass per liter was significant, but no such significant correlation was detected in the field samples for dinoflagellates. The method described will be useful for estimating the proportion of dinoflagellate versus diatom biovolume or biomass and the absolute diatom biovolume or biomass in various aquatic disciplines.},

	Abstract = {Summary This paper identifies those elements of science education which are conducive to environmental awareness and which are congruent with reconstructive or revisionary postmodernism. The first part of the paper discusses the nature of and criticisms of modernism and the role of modern science in the environmental crisis. Developments in postmodern science which supersede modern science are identified. Aspects of science education which support postmodern science are then outlined, with a view to creating a reconstructive science education paradigm which supports environmental sustainability.},

@article{rogers_linkage_2009,
	Abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium is often measured by two statistics, D and r, which can be interpreted as the covariance and the correlation between loci and across gametes. When data consist of diploid genotypes, however, gametes cannot be identified. A variety of iterative statistical methods are used in such cases, all of which assume random mating. Previous work has shown that D and r can be expressed as covariances and correlations across diploid genotypes, provided that mating is random. We show here that this result also holds approximately when mating is nonrandom. This provides a means of estimating these parameters without iteration and without assuming random mating. This estimator is nearly as accurate as the widely used EM estimator and is many times faster.},

@article{berlow_interaction_2004,
	Abstract = {* 1Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory.
* 2Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'ÂÂinteraction strength'ÂÂ. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field.
* 3Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits.
* 4Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity.
* 5Finally, the prime focus on predator-ÂÂprey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

@article{waycott_accelerating_2009,
	Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems and the services they provide are adversely affected by a wide variety of human activities. In particular, seagrass meadows are negatively affected by impacts accruing from the billion or more people who live within 50 km of them. Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services, including an estimated \$1.9 trillion per year in the form of nutrient cycling; an order of magnitude enhancement of coral reef fish productivity; a habitat for thousands of fish, bird, and invertebrate species; and a major food source for endangered dugong, manatee, and green turtle. Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yr{\^a}ÂÂ1 since 1980 and that 29\% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9\% yr{\^a}ÂÂ1 before 1940 to 7\% yr{\^a}ÂÂ1 since 1990. Seagrass loss rates are comparable to those reported for mangroves, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests and place seagrass meadows among the most threatened ecosystems on earth.},

	Abstract = {Ecology of 2 littoral species of caprellid amphipods is compared. Populations of Caprella laeviuscula, a periphyton scraper/filter-feeder, are most dense on eelgrass Zostera marina L. In the absence of C. laeviuscula, periphyton biomass increases 411\% in protected Z. marina beds. The light absorption spectra of periphyton and Z. marina are similar, and C. laeviuscula, by its periphyton removal, may allow Z. marina to grow in areas where it would otherwise be excluded. C. laeviuscula is aggressively dominant over sympatric caprellids, and seasonal predators of C. laeviuscula are absent during winter, the period when periphyton would be most limiting to Z. marina. Populations of Deutella californica, a predator, are most dense on the hydroid Obelia dichotoma (L.). In the O. dichotoma epibiotic community, D. californica is the primary predator, but removal did not change the composition of the community structure. In the absence of other macropredators, the structure of the O. dichotoma epibiotic community depends more on the seasonality of O. dichotoma occurrence than on organismal interactions.},

Despite a growing awareness of the importance of these plants, a full appreciation of their role in coastal ecosystems has yet to be reached. This book provides an entry point for those wishing to learn about seagrass ecology and provides a broad overview of the present state of knowledge. The volume discusses the recent progress in research and current research foci, complemented by extensive literature references to guide the reader to more detailed studies. This book will be valuable to students of marine biology wishing to specialize in this area and to established researchers wanting to enter the field. In addition, it will provide an excellent reference for those involved in the management and conservation of coastal areas that harbor seagrasses.},

@article{bruno_cascading_2005,
	Abstract = {Over-harvesting, habitat loss and exotic invasions have altered predator diversity and composition in a variety of communities which is predicted to affect other trophic levels and ecosystem functioning. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating predator identity and diversity in outdoor mesocosms that contained five species of macroalgae and a macroinvertebrate herbivore assemblage dominated by amphipods and isopods. We used five common predators including four carnivores (crabs, shrimp, blennies and killifish) and one omnivore (pinfish). Three carnivorous predators each induced a strong trophic cascade by reducing herbivore abundance and increasing algal biomass and diversity. Surprisingly, increasing predator diversity reversed these effects on macroalgae and altered algal composition, largely due to the inclusion and performance of omnivorous fish in diverse predator assemblages. Changes in predator diversity can cascade to lower trophic levels; the exact effects, however, will be difficult to predict due to the many complex interactions that occur in diverse food webs.},

@incollection{moore_zostera:_2007,
	Abstract = {The nine species comprising the genus Zostera discussed in this chapter form a widespread and relatively well-studied group of seagrasses. Some of the earliest studies of seagrasses occurred within the genus Zostera, especially the extensively researched Zostera marina L. (Petersen, 1890, 1918). The proximity of this species to industrialized areas and centers of scientific investigation in North America, Europe, and Asia has encouraged a continued scientific focus. Like all seagrasses, those of the genus Zostera live in intertidal and subtidal inshore waters, forming a critical habitat and a basis of the foodweb. Study of the genus Zostera is itself representative of trends in seagrass science, with PAM fluorometry assessments of photosynthesis and genetic investigations among the newer efforts.We here review the current knowledge of this important genus, although space constraints do not allow exhaustive coverage of all past and current Zostera research.We also point to future research directions.},

@book{may_stability_2001,
	Abstract = {What makes populations stabilize? What makes them fluctuate? Are populations in complex ecosystems more stable than populations in simple ecosystems? In 1973, Robert May addressed these questions in this classic book. May investigated the mathematical roots of population dynamics and argued-counter to most current biological thinking-that complex ecosystems in themselves do not lead to population stability. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models and the study of deterministic chaos into ecology, a role chronicled in James Gleick's book Chaos. In the quarter century since its first publication, the book's message has grown in power. Nonlinear models are now at the center of ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever. In a new introduction, the author addresses some of the changes that have swept biology and the biological world since the book's first publication.},

@book{cohen_community_2012,
	Abstract = {Food webs hold a central place in ecology. They describe which organisms feed on which others in natural habitats. This book describes recently discovered empirical regularities in real food webs: it proposes a novel theory unifying many of these regularities, as well as extensive empirical data. After a general introduction, reviewing the empirical and theoretical discoveries about food webs, the second portion of the book shows that community food webs obey several striking phenomenological regularities. Some of these unify, regardless of habitat. Others differentiate, showing that habitat significantly influences structure. The third portion of the book presents a theoretical analysis of some of the unifying empirical regularities. The fourth portion of the book presents 13 community food webs. Collected from scattered sources and carefully edited, they are the empirical basis for the results in the volume. The largest available set of data on community food webs provides a valuable foundation for future studies of community food webs. The book is intended for graduate students, teachers and researchers primarily in ecology. The theoretical portions of the book provide materials useful to teachers of applied combinatorics, in particular, random graphs. Researchers in random graphs will find here unsolved mathematical problems.},

@article{novak_predicting_2011,
	Abstract = {How best to predict the effects of perturbations to ecological communities has been a long-standing goal for both applied and basic ecology. This quest has recently been revived by new empirical data, new analysis methods, and increased computing speed, with the promise that ecologically important insights may be obtainable from a limited knowledge of community interactions. We use empirically based and simulated networks of varying size and connectance to assess two limitations to predicting perturbation responses in multispecies communities: (1) the inaccuracy by which species interaction strengths are empirically quantified and (2) the indeterminacy of species responses due to indirect effects associated with network size and structure. We find that even modest levels of species richness and connectance ({\textasciitilde}25 pairwise interactions) impose high requirements for interaction strength estimates because system indeterminacy rapidly overwhelms predictive insights. Nevertheless, even poorly estimated interaction strengths provide greater average predictive certainty than an approach that uses only the sign of each interaction. Our simulations provide guidance in dealing with the trade-offs involved in maximizing the utility of network approaches for predicting dynamics in multispecies communities.},

@article{turner_fish_2015,
	Abstract = {Genetic identification of aqueous environmental {DNA} ({eDNA}) provides site occupancy inferences for rare aquatic macrofauna that are often easier to obtain than direct observations of organisms. This relative ease makes {eDNA} sampling a valuable tool for conservation biology. Research on the origin, state, transport, and fate of {eDNA} shed by aquatic macrofauna is needed to describe the spatiotemporal context for eDNA-based occupancy inferences and to guide {eDNA} sampling design. We tested the hypothesis that {eDNA} is more concentrated in surficial sediments than in surface water by measuring the concentration of aqueous and sedimentary {eDNA} from an invasive fish, bigheaded Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.), in experimental ponds and natural rivers. We modified a simple, low-cost {DNA} extraction method to yield inhibitor-free {eDNA} from both sediment and water samples. Carp {eDNA} was 8-ÂÂ1800 times more concentrated per gram of sediment than per milliliter of water and was detected in sediments up to 132 days after carp removal --ÂÂ five times longer than any previous reports of macrobial {eDNA} persistence in water. These results may be explained by particle settling and/or retarded degradation of sediment-adsorbed {DNA} molecules. Compared to aqueous eDNA, sedimentary {eDNA} could provide a more abundant and longer-lasting source of genetic material for inferring current-or-past site occupancy by aquatic macrofauna, particularly benthic species. However, resuspension and transport of sedimentary {eDNA} could complicate the spatiotemporal inferences from surface water sampling, which is currently the predominant eDNA-based approach. We discuss these implications in the context of conservation-oriented monitoring in aquatic ecosystems.},

@article{jungbluth_measuring_2013,
	Abstract = {Copepod nauplii are important in plankton food web dynamics, but limited information is available about their ecology due to methodological challenges. Reported here is a new molecular method that was developed, optimized, and tested in laboratory and field samples that uses quantitative {PCR} (qPCR) to identify and estimate the abundance of nauplii of the planktonic copepod, Parvocalanus crassirostris. The overall approach included collection of bulk zooplankton samples in the field, size fractionation to create artificial cohorts of relatively few developmental stages, obtaining {DNA} copy number for each size fraction by qPCR amplification of a target gene region, and estimation of the number of animals in each fraction through application of known {DNA} copy number across developmental stage. Method validation studies found that our qPCR-based approach has comparable accuracy to microscope-based counts of early developmental stages. Naupliar abundance estimates obtained using the two methods on cultured populations were similar; the regression of qPCR estimates on microscope-based counts resulted in a nearly 1:1 ratio (slope = 1.09). The qPCR-based method is superior to traditional identification and quantification methods for nauplii due to its higher taxonomic resolution, sensitive detection over a range of {DNA} quantities, and relatively high throughput sample processing.},

@article{pimm_dynamics_1987,
	Abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of models of aquatic food webs using stability analysis methods previously applied to other types of food web models. Our models expanded traditional Lotka-Volterra models of predator-prey interactions in several ways. We added life history structure to these models in order to investigate its effects. Life history omnivory is different life history stages of a species feeding in trophically different positions in a food web. Such a species might appear omnivorous, integrating across all stages, but the individual stage might not be. Other important additions to the basic models included stock-recruitment relationships between adults and young and food-dependent maturation rates for early life history stages. Complex models of multispecies interactions were built from basic ones by adding new features sequentially. Our analysis revealed five major features of our multispecies, multi-life-stage models. Omnivory reduces stability, as it does in food web models without life history structure. However, life history omnivory reduces stability much less than single life stage omnivory does. Stock recruitment relationships affect the likelihood of finding stable models. If the maturation rate of young varies with their food supply, the chance of finding stable models decreases. Finally, predation loops of the type A eats B, B eats A, or A eats B, B eats C, C eats A greatly reduce model stability. We present both biological and mathematical explanations for these findings. We also discuss their implications for management of marine resources.},

@article{orth_eelgrass_2009,
	Abstract = {Decreases in seagrass abundance reported from numerous locations around the world suggest that seagrass are facing a global crisis. Declining water quality has been identified as the leading cause for most losses. Increased public awareness is leading to expanded efforts for conservation and restoration. Here, we report on abundance patterns and environmental issues facing eelgrass (Zostera marina), the dominant seagrass species in the Chesapeake Bay region in the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA, and describe efforts to promote its protection and restoration. Eelgrass beds in Chesapeake Bay and Chincoteague Bay, which had started to recover from earlier diebacks, have shown a downward trend in the last 5{\^a}ÂÂ10 years, while eelgrass beds in the Virginia coastal bays have substantially increased in abundance during this same time period. Declining water quality appears to be the primary reason for the decreased abundance, but a recent baywide dieback in 2005 was associated with higher than usual summer water temperatures along with poor water clarity. The success of eelgrass in the Virginia coastal bays has been attributed, in part, to slightly cooler water due to their proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. A number of policies and regulations have been adopted in this region since 1983 aimed at protecting and restoring both habitat and water quality. Eelgrass abundance is now one of the criteria for assessing attainment of water clarity goals in this region. Numerous transplant projects have been aimed at restoring eelgrass but most have not succeeded beyond 1 to 2 years. A notable exception is the large-scale restoration effort in the Virginia coastal bays, where seeds distributed beginning in 2001 has initiated an expanding recovery process. Our research on eelgrass abundance patterns in the Chesapeake Bay region and the processes contributing to these patterns have provided a scientific background for management strategies for the protection and restoration of eelgrass and insights into the causes of success and failure of restoration efforts that may have applications to other seagrass systems.},

@article{steneck_kelp_2002,
	Abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of coldwater rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodiversity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40{\^a}ÂÂ60{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$ latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2{\^a}ÂÂ3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the widespread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish- to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin populations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large-scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

@article{reynolds_field_2014,
	Abstract = {We tested the relative effects of nutrient loading, reduced predation, and reduced grazing on eelgrass community dynamics in Chesapeake Bay and found evidence supporting the {\^a}ÂÂmutualistic mesograzer model{\^a}ÂÂ in which small invertebrate grazers control accumulation of epiphytic algae, buffer eutrophication effects, and thus facilitate seagrass dominance. Experimental reduction of crustacean grazers in the field stimulated a nearly sixfold increase in epiphytic algae, and reduced seagrass biomass by 65\% compared to controls with grazers. Nutrient fertilization generally had much weaker effects, but an interaction with mesograzers was key in changing the sign of fertilization effects on the system: aboveground eelgrass biomass was reduced by fertilization under reduced grazing, but increased by fertilization under ambient grazing. When protected from predators in field cages, these mesograzers limited epiphyte blooms even with nutrient enrichment, and nutrients instead enhanced grazer secondary production. Crustacean mesograzers play a key role in maintaining macrophyte (seagrass) dominance in Chesapeake Bay, in buffering eelgrass against eutrophication, and in efficiently transferring nitrogen to higher trophic levels. Yet, these crustacean grazers are also highly sensitive to predator abundance. Reducing nutrient pollution alone is unlikely to restore seagrass meadows where alterations to food webs have reduced populations of algae-feeding mesograzers. Integration of both water quality and fishery management will be more effective in restoring and maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems.},

@article{novak_estimating_2010,
	Abstract = {The complexity of food webs poses a significant hurdle for our growing understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator{\^a}ÂÂprey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator{\^a}ÂÂprey models to these time series. Overall, site-specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack-rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best-performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.},

@article{thom_temporal_1995-1,
	Abstract = {The densities of benthic vegetation and invertebrate grazers were monitored in the seagrass system dominated by Zostera marina L. and Zostera japonica Aschers. \&amp; Graebn. in Padilla Bay, Washington. The primary invertebrate grazers included the isopod Idotea resecata Stimpson, caprellid amphipods and the gastropod Lacuna variegata Carpenter. Densities of Idotea and caprellids peaked in summer, and Lacuna density reached a maximum in winter. Spatial variation in densities was great, and was in the range of four orders of magnitude during some seasons. The mean, experimentally determined, grazing rate by Idotea was 0.95 mg dry wt. m{\^a}ÂÂ2 day{\^a}ÂÂ1. At this rate, Idotea populations alone could remove up to 8 g dry wt. eelgrass m{\^a}ÂÂ2 day{\^a}ÂÂ1. Based upon (1) high grazer densities, (2) the results of grazing experiments, and (3) experiments and observations by others showing the significance of caprellids and Idotea, we conclude that herbivory is an important process in Padilla Bay.},

@book{keller_science_2009,
	Abstract = {Scientists often bring issues to the policy agenda, translating scientific questions into everyday language and political terms. When Roger Revelle characterized Earth as a spaceship in testimony to Congress in 1957, his evocative language framed the issue of our planet's climate vulnerability in a way that technical discourse could not. In this book, Ann Campbell Keller examines the influence of scientists on environmental policy and makes the novel argument that scientists' adherence to the role of neutral advisor varies over the course of the policy-making process.  Keller divides the policy process into three stages{\^a}ÂÂagenda setting, legislation, and implementation{\^a}ÂÂand compares scientists' influence on acid rain and climate change policy at these different stages over the course of several decades. She finds that scientists face more pressure to uphold the ideal of objectivity as policy-making processes advance and become more formalized, and thus are more likely to engage in advocacy and persuasion in the earlier, less formal, agenda-setting stage of the process. In the later, more structured legislative and implementation phases, scientists{\^a}ÂÂworking hard to give the appearance of neutral expertise{\^a}ÂÂcede the role of persuader to others.  Keller draws on theoretical work in political science and science studies and on empirical evidence from scientific reports, news coverage, congressional hearings, and interviews. Focusing on comparable cases and considering scientists' participation in them over time, she offers insights into how the context of decision making affects scientists' policy influence and emphasizes the multiple pathways by which scientific meaning is constructed in public settings.

	Abstract = {Abstract:{\^a}ÂÂ The purpose of this study was to develop a species-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that allows for the detection of salmon species substitution on the commercial market. Species-specific primers and TaqMan{\^A}{\textregistered} probes were developed based on a comprehensive collection of mitochondrial 5{\^a}ÂÂ² cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {\^a}ÂÂbarcode{\^a}ÂÂ sequences. Primers and probes were combined into multiplex assays and tested for specificity against 112 reference samples representing 25 species. Sensitivity and linearity tests were conducted using 10-fold serial dilutions of target {DNA} (single-species samples) and {DNA} admixtures containing the target species at levels of 10\%, 1.0\%, and 0.1\% mixed with a secondary species. The specificity tests showed positive signals for the target {DNA} in both real-time and conventional {PCR} systems. Nonspecific amplification in both systems was minimal; however, false positives were detected at low levels (1.2\% to 8.3\%) in conventional PCR. Detection levels were similar for admixtures and single-species samples based on a 30 {PCR} cycle cut-off, with limits of 0.25 to 2.5 ng (1\% to 10\%) in conventional {PCR} and 0.05 to 5.0 ng (0.1\% to 10\%) in real-time PCR. A small-scale test with food samples showed promising results, with species identification possible even in heavily processed food items. Overall, this study presents a rapid, specific, and sensitive method for salmon species identification that can be applied to mixed-species and heavily processed samples in either conventional or real-time {PCR} formats. Practical Application:{\^a}ÂÂ This study provides a newly developed method for salmon and trout species identification that will assist both industry and regulatory agencies in the detection and prevention of species substitution. This multiplex {PCR} method allows for rapid, high-throughput species identification even in heavily processed and mixed-species samples. An inter-laboratory study is currently being carried out to assess the ability of this method to identify species in a variety of commercial salmon and trout products.},

@article{hampton_quantifying_2013,
	Abstract = {Long-term ecological data sets present opportunities for identifying drivers of community dynamics and quantifying their effects through time series analysis. Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are well known in many other disciplines, such as econometrics, but widespread adoption of MAR methods in ecology and natural resource management has been much slower despite some widely cited ecological examples. Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long-term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in which MAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

@article{eichmiller_relationship_2014,
	Abstract = {Although environmental {DNA} (eDNA) has been used to infer the presence of rare aquatic species, many facets of this technique remain unresolved. In particular, the relationship between {eDNA} and fish distribution is not known. We examined the relationship between the distribution of fish and their {eDNA} (detection rate and concentration) in a lake. A quantitative {PCR} (qPCR) assay for a region within the cytochrome b gene of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio or {\^a}ÂÂcarp{\^a}ÂÂ), an ubiquitous invasive fish, was developed and used to measure {eDNA} in Lake Staring (MN, USA), in which both the density of carp and their distribution have been closely monitored for several years. Surface water, sub-surface water, and sediment were sampled from 22 locations in the lake, including areas frequently used by carp. In water, areas of high carp use had a higher rate of detection and concentration of eDNA, but there was no effect of fish use on sediment eDNA. The detection rate and concentration of {eDNA} in surface and sub-surface water were not significantly different (p{\^a}ÂÂ¥0.5), indicating that {eDNA} did not accumulate in surface water. The detection rate followed the trend: high-use water {\textgreater} low-use water {\textgreater} sediment. The concentration of {eDNA} in sediment samples that were above the limit of detection were several orders of magnitude greater than water on a per mass basis, but a poor limit of detection led to low detection rates. The patchy distribution of {eDNA} in the water of our study lake suggests that the mechanisms that remove {eDNA} from the water column, such as decay and sedimentation, are rapid. Taken together, these results indicate that effective {eDNA} sampling methods should be informed by fish distribution, as {eDNA} concentration was shown to vary dramatically between samples taken less than 100 m apart.},

@article{estes_sea_1995,
	Abstract = {Multiscale patterns of spatial and temporal variation in density and population structure were used to evaluate the generality of a three{\^a}ÂÂtrophic{\^a}ÂÂlevel cascade among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), invertebrate herbivores, and macroalgae in Alaska. The paradigm holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, whereas when sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial patterns were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distributed among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin and kelp abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast Alaska) overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against urchin biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these analyses demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable influence on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and suspension feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between locations with and without sea otters. Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50\% in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100\% in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands. The different kelp colonization rates between southeast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands appear to be caused by large{\^a}ÂÂscale differences in echinoid recruitment coupled with size{\^a}ÂÂselective predation by sea otters for larger urchins. The length of urchin jaws (correlated with test diameter, r2 = 0.968) in sea otter scats indicates that sea urchins {\textless}15{\^a}ÂÂ20 mm test diameter are rarely eaten by foraging sea otters. Sea urchin populations in the Aleutian Islands included high densities of small individuals ({\textless}20 mm test diameter) at all sites and during all years sampled, whereas in southeast Alaska similarly sized urchins were absent from most populations during most years. Small ({\textless}30{\^a}ÂÂ35 mm test diameter) tetracycline{\^a}ÂÂmarked urchins in the Aleutian Islands grew at a maximum rate of {\^A}$\,^{\circ}$10 mm/yr; thus the population must have significant recruitment annually, or at least every several years. In contrast, echinoid recruitment in southeast Alaska was more episodic, with many years to perhaps decades separating significant events. Our findings help explain regional differences in recovery rates of kelp forests following recolonization by sea otters.  See full-text article at JSTOR},

@article{deagle_quantifying_2013-1,
	Abstract = {A goal of many environmental {DNA} barcoding studies is to infer quantitative information about relative abundances of different taxa based on sequence read proportions generated by high-throughput sequencing. However, potential biases associated with this approach are only beginning to be examined. We sequenced {DNA} amplified from faeces (scats) of captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) to investigate whether sequence counts could be used to quantify the seals' diet. Seals were fed fish in fixed proportions, a chordate-specific mitochondrial 16S marker was amplified from scat {DNA} and amplicons sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM{\^a}ÂÂ¢. For a given set of bioinformatic parameters, there was generally low variability between scat samples in proportions of prey species sequences recovered. However, proportions varied substantially depending on sequencing direction, level of quality filtering (due to differences in sequence quality between species) and minimum read length considered. Short primer tags used to identify individual samples also influenced species proportions. In addition, there were complex interactions between factors; for example, the effect of quality filtering was influenced by the primer tag and sequencing direction. Resequencing of a subset of samples revealed some, but not all, biases were consistent between runs. Less stringent data filtering (based on quality scores or read length) generally produced more consistent proportional data, but overall proportions of sequences were very different than dietary mass proportions, indicating additional technical or biological biases are present. Our findings highlight that quantitative interpretations of sequence proportions generated via high-throughput sequencing will require careful experimental design and thoughtful data analysis.},

@article{peterson_trophic_2014,
	Abstract = {Questions of whether trophic cascades occur in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) or Yellowstone National Park's northern range (NR) cannot lead to simple, precise, or definitive answers. Such answers are limited especially by multicausality in the NR and by complex temporal variation in IRNP. Spatial heterogeneity, contingency, and nonequilibrium dynamics also work against simple answers in IRNP and NR. The existence of a trophic cascade in IRNP and NR also depends greatly on how it is defined. For example, some conceive of trophic cascades as entailing essentially any indirect effect of predation. This may be fine, but the primary intellectual value of such a conception may be to assess an important view in community ecology that most species are connected to most other species in a food web through a network of complicated, albeit weak, indirect effects. These circumstances that work against simple answers likely apply to many ecosystems. Despite the challenges of assessing the existence of trophic cascades in IRNP and NR, such assessments result in considerable insights about a more fundamental question: What causes population abundance to fluctuate?},

@article{diaz-real_ngs_2015,
	Abstract = {Understanding the ecological function of species and the structure of communities is crucial in the study of ecological interactions among species. For this purpose, not only the occurrence of particular species but also their abundance in ecological communities is required. However, abundance quantification of species through morphological characters is often difficult or time/money consuming when dealing with elusive or small taxa. Here we tested the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for abundance estimation of two species of feather mites (Proctophyllodes stylifer and Pteronyssoides parinus) under five proportions (16:1, 16:4, 16:16, 16:64, and 16:256 mites) against a mock community composed by Proctophyllodes clavatus and Proctophyllodes sylviae. In all mixtures, we retrieved sequence reads from all species. We found a strong linear relationship between 454 reads and the real proportion of individuals in the mixture for both focal species. The slope for Pr. stylifer was close to one (0.904), and the intercept close to zero ({\^a}ÂÂ0.007), thus showing an almost perfect correspondence between real and estimated proportions. The slope for Pt. parinus was 0.351 and the intercept 0.307, showing that while the estimated proportion increased linearly relative to real proportions of individuals in the samples, proportions were overestimated at low real proportions and underestimated at larger ones. Additionally, pyrosequencing replicates from each {DNA} extraction were highly repeatable (R = 0.920 and 0.972, respectively), showing that the quantification method is highly consistent given a {DNA} extract. Our study suggests that NGS is a promising tool for abundance estimation of feather mites{\^a}ÂÂ communities in birds.},

@article{oconnor_predator_2009,
	Abstract = {* 1In many ecosystems, predator abundance, composition and diversity vary naturally among seasons and habitats. In addition, predator assemblages are changing due to overharvesting, habitat destruction and species invasions.
* 2Predator species composition and richness can influence prey community structure and these effects can cascade to influence plant abundance and composition.
* 3To test the effects of predator presence, composition and species richness on prey abundance, species richness and composition, we conducted three experiments in a subtidal marine food web. Experimental food webs were drawn from species pools of 5{\^a}ÂÂ7 predator species, 19{\^a}ÂÂ52 prey species, benthic micro-algae and 5 macro-algae.
* 4Predators reduced prey abundance in the mesocosm experiment, but this effect was diminished or absent in field experiments. Predator species differed in their effects on prey, but we found no effect of predator richness (via complementarity or selection) on any aspect of prey community structure.
* 5The absence of a predator richness effect could be due to several factors including potentially opposing effects of individual predator species, intraguild predation, or greater importance of colonization relative to competition in structuring prey assemblages. Although predators can have strong top-down effects in this system, selection or resource-use complementarity among predators do not affect prey community structure.},

@article{paine_food_1966,
	Abstract = {It is suggested that local animal species diversity is related to the number of predators in the system and their efficiency in preventing single species from monopolizing some important, limiting, requisite. In the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space. Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse. On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10{\^a}ÂÂ¬ to 49{\^a}ÂÂ¬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},

@article{wilcox_robust_2013,
	Abstract = {Environmental {DNA} (eDNA) is being rapidly adopted as a tool to detect rare animals. Quantitative {PCR} (qPCR) using probe-based chemistries may represent a particularly powerful tool because of the method{\^a}ÂÂs sensitivity, specificity, and potential to quantify target DNA. However, there has been little work understanding the performance of these assays in the presence of closely related, sympatric taxa. If related species cause any cross-amplification or interference, false positives and negatives may be generated. These errors can be disastrous if false positives lead to overestimate the abundance of an endangered species or if false negatives prevent detection of an invasive species. In this study we test factors that influence the specificity and sensitivity of TaqMan MGB assays using co-occurring, closely related brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and bull trout (S. confluentus) as a case study. We found qPCR to be substantially more sensitive than traditional PCR, with a high probability of detection at concentrations as low as 0.5 target copies/{\^A}Âµl. We also found that number and placement of base pair mismatches between the Taqman MGB assay and non-target templates was important to target specificity, and that specificity was most influenced by base pair mismatches in the primers, rather than in the probe. We found that insufficient specificity can result in both false positive and false negative results, particularly in the presence of abundant related species. Our results highlight the utility of qPCR as a highly sensitive {eDNA} tool, and underscore the importance of careful assay design.},

@article{jost2007partitioning,
	Abstract = {Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha Ã beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

@article{Murray2015Frombenchtop,
	Abstract = {Amplicon sequencing has been the method of choice in many high-throughput {DNA} sequencing (HTS) applications. To date there has been a heavy focus on the means by which to analyse the burgeoning amount of data afforded by HTS. In contrast, there has been a distinct lack of attention paid to considerations surrounding the importance of sample preparation and the fidelity of library generation. No amount of high-end bioinformatics can compensate for poorly prepared samples and it is therefore imperative that careful attention is given to sample preparation and library generation within workflows, especially those involving multiple {PCR} steps. This paper redresses this imbalance by focusing on aspects pertaining to the benchtop within typical amplicon workflows: sample screening, the target region, and library generation. Empirical data is provided to illustrate the scope of the problem. Lastly, the impact of various data analysis parameters is also investigated in the context of how the data was initially generated. It is hoped this paper may serve to highlight the importance of pre-analysis workflows in achieving meaningful, future-proof data that can be analysed appropriately. As amplicon sequencing gains traction in a variety of diagnostic applications from forensics to environmental {DNA} (eDNA) it is paramount workflows and analytics are both fit for purpose.},

	Abstract = {{Despite the central role of quantitative {PCR} (qPCR) in the quantification of mRNA transcripts, most analyses of qPCR data are still delegated to the software that comes with the qPCR apparatus. This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed {PCR} efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as ?fold-difference? results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the {PCR} reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the {PCR} reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible {PCR} efficiency values. {PCR} efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in qPCR results was significantly reduced when the mean of these {PCR} efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.}},

	Abstract = {Ocean acidification, the change in seawater carbonate chemistry due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2, affects the physiology of marine organisms in multiple ways1. Diverse competitive and trophic interactions transform the metabolic responses to changes in community composition, seasonal succession and potentially geographical distribution of species. The health of ocean ecosystems depends on whether basic biotic functions are maintained, ecosystem engineers and keystone species are retained, and the spread of nuisance species is avoided2. Here, we show in a field experiment that the toxic microalga Vicicitus globosus has a selective advantage under ocean acidification, increasing its abundance in natural plankton communities at CO2 levels higher than 600 Âµatm and developing blooms above 800 Âµatm CO2. The mass development of V. globosus has had a dramatic impact on the plankton community, preventing the development of the micro- and mesozooplankton communities, thereby disrupting trophic transfer of primary produced organic matter. This has prolonged the residence of particulate matter in the water column and caused a strong decline in export flux. Considering its wide geographical distribution and confirmed role in fish kills3, the proliferation of V. globosus under the IPCC4 CO2 emission representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5 to RCP8.5) scenarios may pose an emergent threat to coastal communities, aquaculture and fisheries.},

@article{Gao2012,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic CO$_{2}$ is accumulating in the atmosphere and trapping reflected infrared radiation, resulting in warming of both terrestrial and ocean ecosystems. At the same time, the dissolution of CO$_{2}$ into seawater is increasing surface ocean acidity, a process known as ocean acidification. Effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers have been documented to be stimulative, inhibitive, or neutral. Elevated CO$_{2}$ and reduced pH levels can interact with solar radiation, which fluctuates over different time scales from limiting to saturating or even stressful levels, to bring about synergistic, antagonistic, or balanced effects on marine primary producers at different depths or under changing weather conditions. However, shoaling of the upper mixed layer (enhanced stratification) due to ocean warming and freshening (rain, ice melting) can lead to additional photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can have both benefits and costs to photosynthetic organisms. Elevated CO$_{2}$ concentrations under low or moderate levels of PAR have been shown to enhance photosynthesis or growth of both phytoplankton and macroalgae; excessive levels of PAR, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated CO$_{2}$, and addition of UV radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar UV-B (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while UV-A (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. In view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of UV-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. The net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or UV stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. Hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments. },

	Abstract = {The fate of diatoms in future acidified oceans could have dramatic implications on marine ecosystems, because they account for \~{}40{\%} of marine primary production. Here, we quantify resilience of Thalassiosira pseudonana in mid-20th century (300 ppm {CO$_2$}) and future (1000 ppm CO2) conditions that cause ocean acidification, using a stress test that probes its ability to recover from incrementally higher amount of low-dose ultraviolet A (UVA) and B (UVB) radiation and re-initiate growth in day--night cycles, limited by nitrogen. While all cultures eventually collapse, those growing at 300 ppm CO2 succumb sooner. The underlying mechanism for collapse appears to be a system failure resulting from ``loss of relational resilience,''that is, inability to adopt physiological states matched to N-availability and phase of the diurnal cycle. Importantly, under elevated CO2 conditions diatoms sustain relational resilience over a longer timeframe, demonstrating increased resilience to future acidified ocean conditions. This stress test framework can be extended to evaluate and predict how various climate change associated stressors may impact microbial community resilience.},

@article{10.3389/fmars.2016.00062,
	Abstract = {Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species' responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents.  We find that general trends in species responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including poleward and deeper distributional shifts, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence of species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with much evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of marine biological impacts of climate change are of the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters) or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

@article{Forster2016,
	Abstract = {{Marine protist diversity inventories have largely focused on planktonic environments, while benthic protists have received relatively little attention. We therefore hypothesize that current diversity surveys have only skimmed the surface of protist diversity in marine sediments, which may harbor greater diversity than planktonic environments. We tested this by analyzing sequences of the hypervariable V4 18S rRNA from benthic and planktonic protist communities sampled in European coastal regions. Despite a similar number of OTUs in both realms, richness estimations indicated that we recovered at least 70\\% of the diversity in planktonic protist communities, but only 33\\% in benthic communities. There was also little overlap of OTUs between planktonic and benthic communities, as well as between separate benthic communities. We argue that these patterns reflect the heterogeneity and diversity of benthic habitats. A comparison of all OTUs against the Protist Ribosomal Reference database showed that a higher proportion of benthic than planktonic protist diversity is missing from public databases; similar results were obtained by comparing all OTUs against environmental references from NCBI's Short Read Archive. We suggest that the benthic realm may therefore be the world's largest reservoir of marine protist diversity, with most taxa at present undescribed.}},

Potential impacts of ocean acidification on the Puget Sound food web. â ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 823â833.Ecosystem impacts of ocean acidification (OA) were explored by imposing scenarios designed to mimic OA on a food web model of Puget Sound, a large estuary in northwestern USA. The productivity of functional groups containing mostly calcifiers was decreased while still allowing other species groups to respond to the scenarios in a dynamic way through indirect effects. Results focus on changes in ecosystem services and structure. Sometimes the direct and indirect effects of OA countered each other due to interactions between predators and prey within the food web, leading to little change in the food web. In other cases, direct and indirect effects caused greater change in the food web than anticipated from direct effects alone. Results were strongly affected by the group on which OA was directly imposed, with changes in copepod productivity being the most influential. While there is much uncertainty in our predictions, focusing on the complex interactions among species, and between species and their environment, will yield better understanding of how ecosystems may respond to OA.}",

    abstract = {Most literature exploring the biological effects of ocean acidification (OA) has focused on macroscopic organisms and far less is known about how marine microbial communities will respond. Studies of OA and microbial community composition and diversity have examined communities from a limited number of ocean regions where the ambient pH is near or above the global average. At San Juan Island (Salish Sea), a region that experiences naturally low pH (average = 7.8), the picoplankton (cell diameter is 0.2–2μm) community was predicted to show no response to experimental acidification in a three-week mesocosm experiment. Filtered seawater mesocosms were maintained via semicontinuous culturing. Three control mesocosms were maintained at pH 8.05 and three acidified mesocosms were maintained at pH 7.60. Total bacteria was quantified daily with a flow cytometer. Microbial communities were sampled every two days via filtration followed by DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplification, and MiSeq sequencing. There was no significant difference in total bacteria between pH treatments throughout the experiment. Acidification significantly reduced Shannon’s diversity over time. During the final week of the experiment, acidification resulted in a significant decrease in Shannon’s diversity, Faith’s phylogenetic distance, and Pielous’s Evenness. ANCOM results revealed four bacterial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), in families Flavobaceriaceae and Hyphomonadaceae that significantly decreased in relative frequency under acidification and two bacterial ASVs, in families Flavobacteriaceae and Alteromonadaceae, that significantly increased under acidification. This is the first OA study on the microbial community of the Salish Sea, a nutrient rich, low pH region, and the first of its kind to report a decrease in both picoplankton richness and evenness with acidification. These findings demonstrate that marine microbial communities that naturally experience acidic conditions are still sensitive to acidification.},
